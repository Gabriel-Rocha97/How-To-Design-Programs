; How would you change the program to create a 200-by-400 scene?
; How would you change the program so that it depicts the landing of a green UFO (unidentified flying object)? 
; How would you change the program so that the background is always blue?
; How would you change the program so that the rocket lands on a flat rock bed that is 10 pixels higher than the bottom of the scene? Donâ€™t forget to change the scenery, too.
